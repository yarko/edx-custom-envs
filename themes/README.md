Place your theme files in this directory.

The directory name will be the theme name you will use in your edX configuration.

For starters, you could clone Stanford's themeing directory here as:

`git clone https://github.com/Stanford-Online/edx-theme.git stanford`

Once you get that working, you can begin replacing and customizing with your own skinning elements.
